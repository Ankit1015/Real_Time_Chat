# Real_Time_Chat
Real-time chat applications are designed to provide a responsive and interactive experience, where messages are delivered and displayed immediately as they are sent. This means that users can engage in conversations and receive updates in real-time, without significant delays. The Project is made by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Wamp Server.
